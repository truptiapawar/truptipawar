/*
You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.
Create a variable named  score and set it to  8
Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator
The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".

Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, youâ€™re about to code some snippets related to the game over condition.
You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.
Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.
