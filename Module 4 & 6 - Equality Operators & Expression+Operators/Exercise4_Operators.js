/*
Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, youâ€™re about to code some snippets related to the game over condition.
You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.
Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.

var timeRemaining= 0;
var energy= 10;
console.log("Game over:", (timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0)); //Game over: true

/*Console log the result of adding two numbers, 5 and 10, using the + operator*/
console.log(5+10); //15
