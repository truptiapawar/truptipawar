You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.
Create a variable named  score and set it to  8
Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator
The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".

Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, youâ€™re about to code some snippets related to the game over condition.
You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.
Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.

You need to code a small program that takes a number and determines if it's an even number (like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).
To achieve this task, you need to declare six variables, as follows:
The first variable, named num1,  should be assigned a number value of 2.
The second variable, named num2, should be assigned a number value of 5.
The third variable, named test1, should be assigned the calculation of num1 % 2. Note: executing this code will return a number.
The fourth variable, named test2, should be assigned the calculation of num2 % 2. Note: executing this code will also return a number.
The fifth variable, named result1, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the test1 variable is not equal to 0, in other words, this: test1 == 0.
The sixth variable, named result2, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the test2 variable is not equal to 0, in other words, test2 == 0.
Run console log two times after you've set the variables:
The first console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num1, "an even number?", result1
The second console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num2, "an even number?", result2
 */
var num1= 2;
var num2 = 5;

var test2 = num2 %2;//1
var result1 = (test1 == 0); // true
var result2 = (test2 == 0); // False
console.log("Is", num1, "an even number?", result1);
console.log ("Is", num2, "an even number?", result2);

//You need to code a small program that takes a number and determines if it's an even number (like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

var result2 = ((num2%2) == 0);
